ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jean-Gabriel Ndongendeba

I am from Brussels!

You've probably never heard of me. And I've never thought writing a README for myself.
Usually READMEs are written for applications and softwares, but here I'm writting a README about me.

jgabnd repository contains my website development project. READ ME.

And you cannot star this repo, even if you click the ðŸ”˜ button.
